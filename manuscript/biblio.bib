abstract = {The effect of using representative calibration sets with fewer samples was explored and discussed. The data set consisted of near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectra of grass samples. The grass samples were taken from different years covering a wide range of species and cultivars. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), a chemometric method, has been applied on NIR spectroscopy data for the determination of the nitrogen (N) concentration in these grass samples. The sample selection method based on NIR spectral data proposed by Puchwein and the CADEX (computer aided design of experiments) algorithm were used and compared. Both Puchwein and CADEX methods provide a calibration set equally distributed in space, and both methods require a minimum prior of knowledge. The samples were also selected randomly using complete random, cultivar random (year fixed), year random (cultivar fixed) and interaction (cultivar Ã— year fixed) random procedures to see the influence of different factors on sample selection. Puchwein's method performed best with lowest RMSEP followed by CADEX, interaction random, year random, cultivar random and complete random. Out of 118 samples of the complete calibration set, 19 samples were selected as minimal number of representative samples. RMSEP values obtained for subsets selected using Puchwein, CADEX and using full calibration set were 0.099{\%} N, 0.109{\%} N and 0.092{\%} N respectively. The result indicated that the selection of representative calibration samples can effectively enhance the cost-effectiveness of NIR spectral analysis by reducing the number of analyzed samples in the calibration set by more than 80{\%}, which substantially reduces the effort of laboratory analyses with no significant loss in prediction accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Designing a sampling strategy for soil property mapping from remote sensing imagery entails making decisions about sampling pattern and number of samples. A consistent number of ancillary data strongly related to the target variable allows applying a sampling strategy that optimally covers the feature space. This study aims at evaluating the capability of multispectral (Sentinel-2) and hyperspectral (EnMAP) satellite data to select the sampling locations in order to collect a calibration dataset for multivariate statistical modelling of the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content in the topsoil of croplands. We tested different sampling strategies based on the feature space, where the ancillary data are the spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 and of simulated EnMAP satellite data acquired in Demmin (north-east Germany). Some selection algorithms require setting the number of samples in advance (random, Kennard-Stones and conditioned Latin Hypercube algorithms) where others automatically provide the ideal number of samples (Puchwein, SELECT and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm). The SOC content and the spectra extracted at the sampling locations were used to build random forest (RF) models. We evaluated the accuracy of the RF estimation models on an independent dataset. The lowest Sentinel-2 normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) for the validation set was obtained using Puchwein (nRMSE: 8.7{\%}), and Kennard-Stones (9.2{\%}) algorithms. The most efficient sampling strategies, expressed as the ratio between accuracy and number of samples per hectare, were obtained using Puchwein with EnMAP and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm with Sentinel-2 data. Hence, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data can be exploited to build a reliable calibration dataset for SOC mapping. For EnMAP, the different selection algorithms provided very similar results. On the other hand, using Puchwein and Kennard-Stones algorithms, Sentinel-2 provided a more accurate estimation than the EnMAP. The calibration datasets provided by EnMAP data provided lower SOC variability and lower prediction accuracy compared to Sentinel-2. This was probably due to EnMAP coarser spatial resolution (30 m) less adequate for linkage to the sampling performed at 10 m scale.},

@article{Liu2019,
abstract = {In constructing models for predicting soil organic matter (SOM) by using visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy, the selection of representative calibration samples is decisive. Few researchers have studied the inclusion of spectral pretreatments in the sample selection strategy. We collected 108 soil samples and applied six commonly used spectral pretreatments to preprocess soil spectra, namely, Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing, first derivative (FD), logarithmic function log(1/R), mean centering (MC), standard normal variate (SNV), and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC). Then, the Kennard-Stone (KS) strategy was used to select calibration samples based on the pretreated spectra, and the size of the calibration set varied from 10 samples to 86 samples (80{\%} of the total samples). These calibration sets were employed to construct partial least squares regression models (PLSR) to predict SOM, and the built models were validated by a set of 21 samples (20{\%} of the total samples). The results showed that 64-78{\%} of the calibration sets selected by the inclusion of pretreatment demonstrated significantly better performance of SOM estimation. The average improved residual predictive deviations (DRPD) were 0.06, 0.13, 0.19, and 0.13 for FD, log(1/R), MSC, and SNV, respectively. Thus, we concluded that spectral pretreatment improves the sample selection strategy, and the degree of its influence varies with the size of the calibration set and the type of pretreatment.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {Extraordinary amounts of data are being produced in many branches of science. Proven statistical methods are no longer applicable with extraordinary large datasets due to computational limitations. A critical step in big data analysis is data reduction. Existing investigations in the context of linear regression focus on subsampling-based methods. However, not only is this approach prone to sampling errors, it also leads to a covariance matrix of the estimators that is typically bounded from below by a term that is of the order of the inverse of the subdata size. We propose a novel approach, termed information-based optimal subdata selection (IBOSS). Compared to leading existing subdata methods, the IBOSS approach has the following advantages: (i) it is significantly faster; (ii) it is suitable for distributed parallel computing; (iii) the variances of the slope parameter estimators converge to 0 as the full data size increases even if the subdata size is fixed, that is, the convergence rate depends on the full data size; (iv) data analysis for IBOSS subdata is straightforward and the sampling distribution of an IBOSS estimator is easy to assess. Theoretical results and extensive simulations demonstrate that the IBOSS approach is superior to subsampling-based methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude. The advantages of the new approach are also illustrated through analysis of real data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
